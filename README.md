# DysonSphereMods:
## Lisf of my mods:
1. LessShipPower - reduce power needed by vessels
2. TechHashReduce - reduce hashes of techs
3. FactoryMultiplier mod support - can overclock buildings 

## Mod ideas:
1. Quick clicks like in factorio to pick up and insert fast with mech
2. Add to overclock all other things: vessels, drones, belt

## Issues/Updates:
### Overclock:
#### issues: 
1. lags the game from version 1.0.4 maybe
2. When shift click it wont copy state of sorter
3. desc of sorters not work while placing

#### things to upgrade:
1. change all things to internal update (less lag)
