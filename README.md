# DysonSphereMods:
## Lisf of my mods:
1. LessShipPower - reduce power needed by vessels
2. TechHashReduce - reduce hashes of techs
3. FactoryMultiplier mod support - can overclock buildings 

## Mod ideas:
1. Quick clicks like in factorio to pick up and insert fast with mech
2. Add to overclock all other things: vessels, drones, belt
3. Only inserter booster
4. QuantumBelt mod
5. custom warp sound
6. power network rename

## Issues/Updates:
### Overclock:
#### issues: 
1. lags the game from version 1.0.4 maybe
2. desc of sorters not work while placing

#### things to upgrade:
1. change all things to internal update (less lag) 
2. mining
3. cfg for power draw
4. mech speed
5. exchanger speed
6. generator produce
