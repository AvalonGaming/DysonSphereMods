# DysonSphereMods:
## Lisf of my mods:
1. LessShipPower - reduce power needed by vessels
2. TechHashReduce - reduce hashes of techs
3. FactoryMultiplier mod support - can overclock buildings 

## Mod ideas:
1. Quick clicks like in factorio to pick up and insert fast with mech
2. Add to overclock all other things: vessels, drones, belt
3. Only inserter booster
